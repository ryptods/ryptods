I am passionate about cybersecurity and enjoy tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects, such as building VM lab environments and conducting vulnerability assessments to deepen my technical expertise. In addition to holding certifications including Network+, Security+, SSCP, CySA+, and Pentest+, I am actively developing my skills through personal projects to prepare for roles in cybersecurity. My background combines technical leadership experience managing electronic systems installations with a strong foundation in IT infrastructure, cloud security, and compliance frameworks.
